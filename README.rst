The project is originated from `seanzhengw/sphinx-pages`_,
it helps you building Sphinx documentation and commit specified branch.

.. _seanzhengw/sphinx-pages: https://github.com/seanzhengw/sphinx-pages.

Usage
=====

.. note::

   You should enable extension ``sphinx.ext.githubpages`` in your ``conf.py``
   first.

The simplpest Workflow file looks like that:

.. code-block:: yaml

   - name: Build and Commit
     uses: sphinx-notes/pages@master

But note that this actions only help you build and commit Sphinx documentation,
we need another tow actions: one for checking out and one for push to remote,
so your workflow file should be:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: Pages
   on: [push]
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - name: Checkout
         uses: actions/checkout@master
         with:
           fetch-depth: 0 # otherwise, you will failed to push refs to dest repo
       - name: Build and Commit
         uses: sphinx-notes/pages@master
       - name: Push changes
         uses: ad-m/github-push-action@master
         with:
           github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
